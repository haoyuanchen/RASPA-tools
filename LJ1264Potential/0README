Implementation of LJ 12-6-4 potential in RASPA. The 'HYDRATED_ION_WATER' potential in RASPA does not work properly for some reasons.
New potential is called "GENERIC2_HC" and works.
Just copy all the .c and .h files to the src directory in RASPA and re-compile. You may want to backup the original files first.
