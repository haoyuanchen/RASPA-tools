Implementation of LJ 12-6-4 potential in RASPA. The 'HYDRATED_ION_WATER' potential in RASPA does not work properly for some reasons.
New potential is called "GENERIC2_HC" and works.
Just copy all the .c and .h files to the src directory in RASPA and re-compile. You may want to backup the original files first.

To use the 12-6-4 potential, if the parameters in LJ1264.pair looks like:

Mg         OwTIP3P                             A           B   C

you should make your force_field.def file like:

# rules to overwrite
0
# number of defined interactions
1
# type      type2       interaction
Mg_         Ow          GENERIC2_HC     0  0  C  B  0  -A
# mixing rules to overwrite
0

and force_field_mixing_rules.def should remain unchanged.
