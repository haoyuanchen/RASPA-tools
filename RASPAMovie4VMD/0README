VMD cannot handle trajectory with varying number of atoms, which is inconvenient for GCMC simulations.
This script creates additional adsorbates that overlap with others to solve this problem.
It makes the Movie_*component*.pdb file (trajectory) generated in RASPA GCMC simulations visualizable in VMD.
